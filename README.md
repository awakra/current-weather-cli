## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awakra/current-weather-cli.git
   cd current-weather-cli
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Make sure you have it installed, then run:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This command will create a virtual environment and install all necessary packages like `requests`, `typer`, and `pytest`.

## Configuration

This application requires an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to function.

1. **Get your API Key:**
   Sign up for a free account on OpenWeatherMap and get your API key.

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Add your API Key:**
   Edit the `.env` file and add your API key like this:

   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_from_the_website"
   ```

   > **Note:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and will **not** be committed to the repository, keeping your secrets safe.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can run the application using Poetry:

**Get the weather for a city:**

```bash
poetry run weather "New York"
